3rd project for computational physics class: graphene band structure

./anderson-ipr
Find the inverse participation ratio for graphene using the Anderson
model.

./anderson-spacing
Plot the density of spacing between energy levels of graphene using
the Anderson model.

./anderson-states
Plot the density of states (energy levels) of graphene using the Andreson
model.

./c-anderson-(ipr|spacing|states)
Same as anderson-(ipr|spacing|states), but written in C.

./energies
Plot the energy graphene as a function of the wavevector (3D plot) using
an analytic model.

./states
Plot the density of states (energy levels) of graphene using an analytic
model.
